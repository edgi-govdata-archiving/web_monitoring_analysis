# Explaining change and fostering accountability in digital environmental governance
The data and scripts stored in this repo support a paper under review (as of July 31 2020) at _PLOS One_. A pre-print version is available from SocArxiv: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vsjc/

# Default branch - 'main'
The 'master' branch is no longer the repo's primary branch in line with EDGI's policy decided here: https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/issues/241

> If someone has a local clone, they can update their locals like this:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -m master main
$ git fetch
$ git branch --unset-upstream
$ git branch -u origin/main
$ git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```
> The above steps accomplish:
> - Go to the master branch
> - Rename master to main locally
> - Get the latest commits from the server
> - Remove the link to origin/master
> - Add a link to origin/main
> - Update the default branch to be origin/main
